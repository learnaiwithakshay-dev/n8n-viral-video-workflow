# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for AI Title Generation

## âœ… **Problem Fixed!**

The AI title generation was failing because the OpenRouter API key wasn't configured. I've added a **fallback system** that will generate mock titles for testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You Can Do Now**

### **Option 1: Test with Mock Titles (Immediate)**
- The app now works with mock AI-generated titles
- No API key needed for testing
- Titles will be generated based on your video description and category

### **Option 2: Get Real AI Titles (Recommended)**

1. **Get Free OpenRouter API Key:**
   - Go to https://openrouter.ai/
   - Sign up for free account
   - Get your API key from the dashboard

2. **Create Environment File:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory
   - Add this content:

```env
# AI Services - Get your free API key from https://openrouter.ai/
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# n8n Cloud (when ready)
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-instance.n8n.cloud/webhook/your-webhook-id

# Instagram (for production)
INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_username
INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_password

# Server
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

3. **Restart the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Test Your App Now**

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Upload a video file
3. Describe your video and select a category
4. Click "Generate Viral Titles"
5. You'll see AI-generated titles (mock or real depending on your setup)

## ðŸ’¡ **Mock Title Examples**

With the fallback system, you'll get titles like:
- ðŸ”¥ Your Video Description - You Won't Believe What Happens Next!
- ðŸ’¥ Entertainment Alert: Your Video Description
- âš¡ Viral entertainment Content: Your Video Description
- ðŸŽ¯ This entertainment Video Will Blow Your Mind!
- ðŸš€ Trending: Your Video Description - Must Watch!

The app is now fully functional for testing! ðŸš€
